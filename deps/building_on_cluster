In primme/Make_flags, switch compiler flags by uncommenting the using intel compilers block and also the building matlab interface block

Set $INCLUDE using
export INCLUDE="-I/usr/local/shared/cloog/0.18.1//include -I/usr/local/shared/gmp/6.0.0//include:/usr/local/shared/mpfr/3.1.2/include -I/usr/local/shared/mpc/1.0.2/include -I/usr/local/shared/intel/composer_xe_2015/mkl//include"

instead of the default value for INCLUDE which is "/usr/local/shared/cloog/0.18.1//include:/usr/local/shared/gmp/6.0.0//include:/usr/local/shared/mpfr/3.1.2/include:/usr/local/shared/mpc/1.0.2/include:/usr/local/shared/intel/composer_xe_2015/mkl//include"

then run 
"make solib"

use --dry-run first to check
